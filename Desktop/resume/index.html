High technologies, Robotics, Cryptocurrency, Artificial intelligence move world forward very quickly. According to that, i have a question to myself: what will be my function in this future? So i think the most smarter decision is to be a part of this community. Now this is my main purpose of training in EPAM.</p>
				<p><strong>About my programming skills</strong>: I don’t have any JavaScript practice. Just training in console with algorithms and functions. But I have some experience in using HTML and CSS. There are some websites which I corrected during last 2-3 years in freelance.</p>
				<p><strong>About my english speaking level</strong>: My english level is B1 by str.by testing, so i can understand english quite well. My main problem in that my vocabulary in not so big. But i’ll learn it more in future. There are a lot of good websites, where everyone can learn to speak english for free. I will use it also.</p>
